A test project aimed at benchmarking mobile applications with OpenLayers

A patch targeted at OpenLayers trunk is provided in this directory to prevent animated panning (which slows down everything).

The final build is "Closure Compiled" using "Simple" optimizations (with the help of http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home). The resulting build is called OpenLayers.cc.js
